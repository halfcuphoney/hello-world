hello whoever-read-this:
  two month ago, i know nothing about coding ,and some day i say, why don't i learn some coding? Then i searched a little bit,and decided with html, after which,i learned css, js,and find out jquery is quite difficult,so i turned to python. i learned python for a while,but it feels like i can't do anything with it.i feel so sad,and don't where to go.
 i hope when some day i read this in the future,i could recall today with joy,not pity,bucause i insisted and became a coder
